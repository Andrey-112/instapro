Professional instagram tool for developers.

Hi everyone. I tried to make an perfect instagram tool for developers and not the alpha version of this script has been released and i hope i will find interested developers to help me with it. I appreciate any help.

If you are not fluent with python it would be hard enough to use this scripts because there are no ready-to-go examples or clear documentation. 

The examples of usage you can find in examples folder. I recommend you to look in _notebooks/_ folder.
