Professional instagram tool for developers.

Hi everyone. I tried to make the perfect instagram tool for developers and now that the alpha version of this script has been released, I hope I will find interested developers to help me with it.    
I appreciate any help.

If you are not fluent with python it would be hard enough to use this scripts because there are no ready-to-go examples or clear documentation. 

You can find the examples, on how to use it, in the examples folder. I recommend to look in the _notebooks/_ folder.
